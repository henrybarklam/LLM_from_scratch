# Building LLMs from Scratch

This repository documents my learning journey through **Building LLMs from Scratch** by Sebastian Raschka. I'm working through the concepts, code examples, and exercises chapter by chapter to understand how large language models are built from first principles.

## Structure

The code is organized by chapter:

- **`LLM_from_scratch/`** - Main directory containing chapter-by-chapter implementations
  - **`Chapter_2/`** - Data loading, tokenization, and dataset creation
  - More chapters to come...

## What I'm Learning

This book covers:
- Tokenization and text preprocessing
- Dataset creation and batching for LLM training
- Transformer architecture fundamentals
- Model training and fine-tuning
- Practical implementation of LLM components

## Getting Started

Each chapter contains its own Python scripts demonstrating concepts. To explore a specific chapter:

```bash
cd LLM_from_scratch/Chapter_2
python dataset_v1.py
```

## Notes

As I progress through the book, I'll be adding implementations and notes for key concepts. Each chapter builds on previous knowledge, starting from tokenization and working toward complete language model training.
